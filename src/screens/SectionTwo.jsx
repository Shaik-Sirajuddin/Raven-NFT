                            <p className="text-grey" style={{"textAlign":"left"}}>About 6 - 8 months After Mintout, Raven NFT will begin paying holders residually for as long as they hold raven NFT. The Rate and Quantity at which holders will be paid is dependent on the Tier and quantity of Raven NFTs owned and as the wealth of the company grows, so will the payment amount that will be distributed to holders. For example, If you hold a Tier 3 token you may be distributed 1,200 Dollars Monthly for as long as you are a holder whereas a Tier 1 token Holder may receive 500 Dollars monthly for as long as they are a holder. Additionally, If you hold more than just one token your monthly earnings will be adjusted according to the quantity of Raven Tokens held as well as their tiers. An official Formula depicting the precise monthly payment that takes into account quantity and the tier of a holder's Raven NFT token will be developed shortly after mint out. Holders will also gain early access and discounted prices to all mints associated and connected to Raven NFT.
